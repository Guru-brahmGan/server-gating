## Overview

The GPU.net Node.js server is a crucial component of the GPU.net ecosystem, providing a backend interface for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, handling user transactions, managing database operations, and processing external API requests. This documentation outlines the server's architecture, key functionalities, and setup instructions.

## Architecture

The server is built using Node.js and Express, offering a scalable and efficient way to handle HTTP requests. It integrates with MongoDB for data persistence and uses the Stripe API for payment processing. The server also interacts with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain for specific operations related to GPU.net.

### Key Components

- **Express Framework:** Simplifies the creation of web server and API endpoints.
- **Stripe Integration:** Manages payment processing and handles webhook events from Stripe.
- **Ethereum Smart Contract Interaction:** Uses `gpuMarketplaceContractInstance` to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **MongoDB Database:** Stores and retrieves data related to users, transactions, and other relevant information.
- **Event Logging:** Monitors and logs blockchain events.
- **CORS Middleware:** Ensures cross-origin resource sharing is handled correctly.

## Features

- **Stripe Webhook Handling:** Processes events from Stripe, particularly for payment confirmations.
- **Smart Contract Interaction:** Facilitates communication with the Ethereum blockchain to perform actions like updating GPoints.
- **API Routing:** Manages various API routes for different functionalities like user registration, machine listing, and order processing.
- **Database Operations:** Handles CRUD operations with MongoDB.
- **Security and Error Handling:** Implements security best practices and robust error handling mechanisms.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- MongoDB
- Ethereum Node or Infura Account
- Stripe Account

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd [repository_name]
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following variables:
   - `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your Stripe secret key.
   - `MONGO_URL`: MongoDB connection string.
   - `ETHEREUM_NODE_URL`: URL of the Ethereum node or Infura endpoint.
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Secret for Stripe webhook verification.

4. **Start the Server:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## API Endpoints

The server provides various endpoints under the `/api` path. Each endpoint serves a specific purpose, such as handling user requests, processing transactions, and interacting with the blockchain.

- **POST `/api/other/stripeWebhook`**: Handles Stripe webhook events.
- **GET `/api/machines/available`**: Retrieves available machines for rent.
- **POST `/api/users/register`**: Registers a new user.
- ... _[additional endpoints as per your implementation]_

## Security and Best Practices

- Implement HTTPS for secure communication.
- Use input validation and rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
- Monitor server performance and set up alerting for downtime or errors.

## Testing

- Write unit and integration tests for API endpoints.
- Use tools like Postman or Swagger for API testing and documentation.

## Conclusion

The GPU.net Node.js server is a vital part of the platform, enabling seamless interactions between users, the blockchain, and external services. This documentation provides a foundation for understanding, setting up, and extending the server's capabilities.
